# Financial Datasets: Quick Start

Use these beginner-friendly data sources. Start small (few tickers, short dates) to keep things fast and clear.

## Yahoo Finance (Free)

Suitable for equities, indices, ETFs.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Minimal example
df = yf.download(["AAPL", "MSFT"], start="2022-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
df["Adj Close"].head()

# Simple return calculation
returns = df["Adj Close"].pct_change().dropna()
returns.tail()
```

Notes: data may be adjusted and occasionally revised; verify for assessment work.

## FRED (Macro/Economic)

Federal Reserve economic series (GDP, CPI, rates).

```python
import pandas_datareader.data as web

gdp = web.DataReader("GDP", "fred", start="2018-01-01")
gdp.tail()
```

## CSV Fallback (Offline-friendly)

If network access is blocked, work from local CSVs.

```python
import pandas as pd

prices = pd.read_csv("prices_sample.csv", parse_dates=["Date"], index_col="Date")
prices.head()
```

How to create a CSV quickly:

```python
# After pulling with yfinance, save for later offline use
df["Adj Close"].to_csv("prices_sample.csv")
```

## Good practises

- Start with one or two tickers, short windows
- Check `.info()` or documentation for series definitions
- Keep a small “data” folder with versioned CSV snapshots

## JKP Global Factor Data (Replication resources)

The JKP initiative (Jensen–Kelly–Pedersen) provides a curated, global factor dataset, documentation, and analysis tools:

- Portal: https://jkpfactors.com
- Documentation (factor definitions, availability): https://jkpfactors.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Documentation.pdf
- JKP/WRDS Guide: https://jkpfactors.com/jkp-wrds-guide
- GitHub (related research replication): https://github.com/bkelly-lab/ReplicationCrisis

Notes and usage
- Access may require registration and/or institutional subscriptions (e.g., WRDS). Follow the portal’s terms and documentation.
- For coursework, prefer small, well‑documented slices (few factors, limited horizon) and record exactly which series/versions you used.
- Context papers: @jensen2024replication; methodology links to @kelly2024complexity and @gu2020ml for model design and evaluation.
