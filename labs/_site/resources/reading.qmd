# Usage Notes

- The readings above are deliberately selective and rigorous; they anchor each theme for both modules.  
- For undergraduate-level modules, use them as guided readings (focus on concepts and evidence).  
- For postgraduate-level modules, expect critical appraisal and application.  
- Coding work should link to methods in the papers (e.g., ML baselines, text sentiment, event study design).
