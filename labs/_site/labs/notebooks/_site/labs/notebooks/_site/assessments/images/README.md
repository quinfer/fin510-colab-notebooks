## Image Specifications

**Format**: PNG (recommended for clarity and compatibility)  
**Resolution**: 1200x800px minimum (high enough for clarity when displayed in Blackboard)  
**Style**: Professional, academic, clear labels  
**Color**: Use colorblind-friendly palettes where possible  

## Generation Status

⚠️ **IMAGES NOT YET GENERATED**

These images need to be created before deploying the test to Blackboard. Options:

1. **Generate using Python/Matplotlib** (recommended for reproducibility)
   - Create script: `scripts/generate_visual_mcq_images.py`
   - Use realistic synthetic data
   - Save to this directory
   
2. **Extract from existing slides** (if suitable visuals already exist)
   - Check Week 4-6 slide decks
   - Export high-resolution versions
   - Rename to match required filenames

3. **Create manually using visualization tools** (Tableau, Excel, etc.)
   - Follow specifications above
   - Ensure professional appearance
   - Save with correct filenames

## Next Steps

1. **Priority**: Generate or source all 14 images
2. Verify images render correctly in HTML (`VISUAL_MCQ_WEEKS4-6.html`)
3. Upload images to Blackboard before creating test questions
4. Test image display in Blackboard preview mode

## Notes

- Images should be self-explanatory with clear axes labels
- Legends should be visible and readable
- Annotations (e.g., "Crisis Period" shaded regions) help guide interpretation
- Consider adding grid lines for easier visual estimation
- Use consistent styling across related questions (e.g., all Week 4 images use similar color scheme)
